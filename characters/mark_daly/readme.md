Prompt 1: (Happy Mark with a little girl)
Now we need a maths professor. Hes a 40 year old man with copper hair, 
a big busy beard and a ponytail. He has the childlike joy of someone doing exactly what they love and as a mathematician, 
he truly seems to love talking and sharing math related ideas. He's also into AI. He has a bit of a belly, 
wears big work boots, jeans and a professor jumper with a shirt. There is a need to be liked e.g. 
he wants students to see him as young and relevant. He makes jokes about how the students used to play pranks on 
him but you better not.. *wink wink*. Red faced, has occasional migraines and is disappointed when others don't share his passion. 
It could be hard to keep his attention when hes doing something he enjoys doing.

Visual Features
Age & Hair: About 40, copper hair tied in a ponytail, with a big bushy beard.
Expression: Joyful, wide-eyed, slightly red in the face — always ready to share an exciting thought, but also with a trace of intensity.
Body Shape: Slight belly, not overweight but “professor comfy.”
Clothes: Jeans, professor jumper over a shirt, sleeves a bit rolled. Big sturdy work boots.
Accessories / Hints: Could be holding chalk, a marker, or a notebook full of scribbles. Maybe a small AI reference doodle (like a neural net sketch or little robot head) in the corner.
Personality Cues in the Image
Energy: One hand gesturing as if mid-explanation, the other holding something maths-related (chalk, equations on paper).
Wink factor: A playful twinkle, as though he’s just cracked a joke about past student pranks.
Need to be liked: Clothing and posture not too “stuffy,” a bit casual-professor — jeans and boots show he’s trying to stay relatable.
Passion: Surrounded by faint sketches of maths symbols (π, integrals, matrices) and maybe a thought bubble with “AI” doodle hints.
