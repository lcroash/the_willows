Mike Russell character info.

**Prompt 1: (Happy Mike)**

generate, in the same style, an image of a software quality assurance lecturer. 
He is middle height, has brown hair with a slightly thinning bald patch on the crown of his head, 
very light balding, a slight underbite that protrudes his chin slightly to give a a sense of pomp and grandure. 
Wears typical lecture clothes, seems like it's a substantial part of his character. 
He has a phd in software development but still chooses to use the title "Dr" in his name. 
He constantly refers to old software projects and how they failed with particular emphasis on his seniority, 
his success and him being a bit of a big deal "Aren't you luck to learn from me" type vibes. 
He has a touch of metro-sexuality but only a little.

**Prompt 2: (Angry Mike)**
No glasses, more of a wool jumper and shirt type. Less smirk and more superior. 
Add a name badge with "Dr" on it and a little doll in the back with "JAVA" on it.

**Prompt 3: (Approachable Mike)**
Less grumpy, same superiority but a more accessible superiority. 
He knows he's better than you and thats fine because hes here to help. 
He'll happy speak down to you but have a sense that hes giving to you when he does. 
Less quiff, not a crew cut but a reasonable tight haircut and the doll should be in a more child friendly type position. 
He likes to play with his doll.
