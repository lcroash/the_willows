Dan related.


**Prompt 1: (No socks, just him)**
Generate an image in the same style. For a denim loving nihilist called Dan. 
Hes from a small farming village in longford Ireland and has a touch of an inferiority
complex due to being a small kid with esoteric pursuits in his community and a slightly 
smarter more obviously talented younger brother. He also has a deep seated dislike for the british, 
like most good longfordians, maybe even a secret IRA connection. Floppy hair, grown out of disregard 
rather than style. Hunched posture with a southern drawl type expression anf overall speed of operation. 
Drives an old car because it still runs fine. Aspirations of greatness, unrealised and has a liking for anime, 
particularly thr darker ones and is a zelda and breathe of fire fan.

**Prompt 2: (4 stages of dan)**
Build a progression from early life to oldest using the Union Jack image of the man that is tired.
Panel 1 – Childhood
Small, barefoot boy version.
Floppy hair, a bit scruffy.
Worn shorts, plain shirt.
Innocent but already with a “hmm” expression — as if the world’s too heavy even at that age.
Panel 2 – Adolescence (Dan, the Longford denim nihilist)
The denim jacket + jeans character (the one we already created).
Slight hunch, floppy unstyled hair.
Barefoot or with worn shoes.
Cynical look but with that underlying Irish stubbornness.
Panel 3 – Early Adulthood (Optional transition)
Taller, maybe sharper features.
Could carry a pint, cigarette, or a symbol of faded ambition.
Halfway between Dan and the final English guy.
Panel 4 – Final Form
The English “I’m so tired” guy in the Union Jack.
Full slump, stubble, drained face, utterly beaten down.

**Prompt 3: (4 stages with worse posture)**
Can you adjust to have a slightly worse posture and add more of a tired of having to deal with people rather than just tired.

**Prompt 4: (Family with everyone smiling)**
Generate a whole family assuming these different age groups are different 
family members rather than the same person. Add a baby in a stroller maybe 3, 
a sister around 6, another around 14, a mum and a granny.

**Prompt 5: (Angry balding dad)**

It should include all the male versions too. The guys should all be different versions of the dad, 
withe various levels of scowl, hunch and misanthropy. The girls should be all fairly normal.
Male Side (Dad & His Versions)
Baby boy (stroller, ~3 yrs): Already a bit grumpy, furrowed brow, arms folded in stroller instead of smiling.
Young boy (~6 yrs): Tired-looking, slight scowl, hands in pockets, starting to hunch.
Teen boy (~14 yrs): Denim jacket version, floppy hair, more obvious slouch, full-on “don’t talk to me” look.
Dad (~40 yrs): Hunched posture, tired of everyone, beer in hand, stubbled face, heavy scowl.
Grandad (~65+ yrs): Same weary traits, leaning slightly forward, perhaps hands clasped behind his back, full-on misanthropic scowl.
Female Side (Normal progression, contrast to the males)
Baby girl (~3 yrs): Happy, pink clothes, big eyes, smiling.
Young girl (~6 yrs): Cheerful, playful stance, maybe holding a toy.
Teen girl (~14 yrs): Casual clothes, normal posture, mildly aloof but still grounded.
Mum (~40 yrs): Warm smile, neat dress, normal posture, providing balance.
Granny (~65+ yrs): Kind and composed, glasses, bun, grounded presence.
This way, the guys all get progressively darker, scowlier, and more hunched, while the women remain fairly normal — a deliberate contrast.

**Prompt 6: (The Oh Reallys)**

Add a title of "The Oh-Reallys"
All characters arranged side by side like a posed family photo.
Mix the males and females so it feels like a true family group, not two separate lineups.
Title “The Oh-Reallys” in bold cartoon lettering centered above the family.
Members (with balance in placement)
Baby boy in stroller (grumpy, folded arms).
Baby girl (~3) (smiling, bright pink).
Young boy (~6) – “NO FUTURE” shirt, scowl.
Young girl (~6) – happy, cheerful contrast beside him.
Teen boy (~14) – denim, floppy hair, scowl.
Teen girl (~14) – casual, confident, relaxed expression.
Dad (~40s) – beer in hand, misanthropic.
Mum (~40s) – calm, neat dress, smiling warmly.
Union Jack man (~50s) – barefoot, sagging, "I’m so tired" speech bubble.
Granny (~65+) – female scowl, hunched but matriarchal.
Grandad (~65+) – thin, scowly, hands clasped behind his back.
Overall Feel
The contrast between scowly, hunched men and the cheerful females should be the central gag.
The granny scowl ties her visually to the male side of the family, while mum + daughters lighten the lineup.
The title “The Oh-Reallys” sets the tone as a parody-style dysfunctional family portrait.
